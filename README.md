# f5-openstack-docs
Documentation for all F5 OpenStack projects

## What It Does
This repo is used to publish documentation for all F5 OpenStack projects with [Jekyll]() and [GitHub Pages]().

## How It Works
This repo contains all of the formatting and styling content for the website. It also houses documentation which either combines content from other project repos or doesn't have a logical home elsewhere. 

We use [Travis CI]() to build the site with Jekyll; check the code with [HTML Proofer](); and deploy automatically upon successful builds.

- openstack-f5-lbaasv1
