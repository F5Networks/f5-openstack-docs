# f5-openstack-docs
Documentation for all F5 OpenStack projects

## What It Does
This repo houses the configuration materials for [docs.openstack.f5.com]. We use [Jekyll] and [Travis CI] to build and to deploy the site, respectively.

## How It Works
A Travis CI build kicks off automatically when a change is committed to this repo. The build script uses `jekyll build` to build the site, then runs [`HTML::Proofer`] to check the code. After a successful build -- i.e., jekyll built the site and the HTML proofer found no issues -- the site files generated by the build are pushed to the 'site' branch of the repo. That content is then automatically deployed to the root folder of the Dev bucket in S3.
