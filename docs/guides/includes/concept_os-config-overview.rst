Overview
--------

This guide will allow a user who already has an all-in-one OpenStack |openstack| deployment to configure it to attach to an existing external network.

The instructions presented here were prepared from a Packstack deployment on OpenStack |openstack| using CentOS 7. We've found both of the following documentation sets extremely helpful and recommend consulting them for any issues you may encounter.
