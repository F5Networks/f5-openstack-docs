Overview
--------

This guide will allow a user who is largely unfamiliar with OpenStack to create an all-in-one, bare metal installation of `OpenStack RDO <https://www.rdoproject.org/>`_. The instructions presented here guide you through installing an operating system and using `Packstack <https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Packstack>`_ to deploy OpenStack.

The information presented here is based on the RDO project `Quickstart guide <https://www.rdoproject.org/install/quickstart/>`_. We've found the RDO documentation set extremely helpful and recommend consulting it for any issues you may encounter.

.. caution::

    This guide describes how to deploy OpenStack using Packstack. Both are open source projects that are continually changing. You may see some variations between the commands presented here and those available in your environment.
