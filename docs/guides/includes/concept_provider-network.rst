Provider Networks
-----------------

In OpenStack Neutron, the provider network maps to your existing physical network. There are two types of provider networks: flat and VLAN.

In a flat, or untagged, provider network, all instances reside on the same network. In a VLAN, or tagged, provider network, instances can reside in multiple distinct networks. You can use tagging to map the tenant or provider networks both to existing physical networks and to BIG-IP®.

Provider Networks and BIG-IP®
`````````````````````````````

BIG-IP® can work with either type of provider network. Users with VLAN provider networks can use the :ref:`F5® LBaaS plugins <lbaasv1:f5-lbaasv1-plugin-architecture-overview>` in :ref:`global routed mode <lbaasv1:global-routed-mode>` or :ref:`L2-adjacent mode <lbaasv1:l2-adjacent-mode>` to provision services from BIG-IP®. Users with a flat provider network must use the F5® LBaaS plugins in global routed mode with a BIG-IP® deployed within OpenStack (referred to as :dfn:`overcloud`). If BIG-IP® is deployed externally (referred to as :dfn:`undercloud`), the F5® agent must be configured to use L2/L3-adjacent mode.
