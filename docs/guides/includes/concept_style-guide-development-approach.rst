The Development Approach
````````````````````````

Developing software documentation like code is kind of a hot topic right now [#]_ among technical writers. The `Write the Docs <http://www.writethedocs.org/>`_ North America conferences in `2015 <http://www.writethedocs.org/conf/na/2015/>`_ and `2016 <http://www.writethedocs.org/conf/na/2016/>`_ both featured presentations and/or panels focusing on bringing docs into the development workflow.

Our team was committed to making documentation part of the development workflow from the start. We had the unique (to F5, at that time) position of having a tech writer 'embedded' in the development team, so to speak; for us, it seemed perfectly natural that docs would live in the same GitHub repo as code, use the same processes, and adhere to the same timelines. Since we're developing open source software, the docs are open source, too.

What is "open source", anyway?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

"Open source" software is software for which the source code is made freely available and can be redistributed and modified (with the appropriate credit given to the original source, per its license / copyright, of course).

F5's OpenStack product suite constitutes the company's first foray into the open source community. Likewise, the documentation for the F5 OpenStack products is the company's first attempt to develop openly-sourced documentation. We've made a deliberate effort to adopt/adapt tools and best practices from the open source community on both fronts.
