Drafts
``````

We highly recommend building drafts of your documentation while you work on it. This makes it easier both to identify 'bugs' in your docs (for example, incorrect Sphinx syntax, inconsistent bullet or ordered lists, etc.) and to view your content from the user's perspective.

The ``make html`` command builds the documentation set based on configurations included in the Makefile. [#]_ You can also use the ``sphinx-build`` command, which allows you to pass in arguments that customize the build process. We often use the command ``sphinx-build docs/ docs/_build``, which identifies ``docs/`` as the source directory and ``docs/_build`` as the directory in which the generated output should be saved. You can open the HTML files generated by the build in your browser, rebuild, and reload as you write to view your changes.
