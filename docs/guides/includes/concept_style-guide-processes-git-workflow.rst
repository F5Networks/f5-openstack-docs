Git Workflow
````````````

Use the Git workflow that works best for your team. The F5 OpenStack dev team uses the same :ref:`branching strategy <F5 Development Branching Strategy>` and a `forking workflow`_ for all of our projects. If you're new to Git and/or version control in general, we recommend getting started with the `GitHub Hello World`_ tutorial.

Peer Review
~~~~~~~~~~~

Peer review is an essential part of any collaborative development workflow. Feedback from others -- including constructive criticism -- makes your contribution better. It helps you find incorrect or inconsistant details you may have overlooked, think about things from another person's (or, user's) perspective, and perhaps even learn something new. We handle peer review by assigning `pull requests`_ in GitHub to specific team members (for example: `#132 <https://github.com/F5Networks/f5-openstack-docs/pull/132>`_).

.. tip::

    For more information about how to conduct peer review in GitHub, see the excellent video `How GitHub Uses GitHub to Document GitHub <http://videos.writethedocs.org/video/96/how-github-uses-github-to-document-github>`_.
