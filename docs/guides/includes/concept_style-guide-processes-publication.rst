If you followed the Read the Docs `getting started guide <https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html>`_, you should already be all set on this front.

.. tip::

    - If you set up the `GitHub RTD webhook`_, you don't have to build docs manually for versions that are already set to 'active'.
    - Create a `requirements.docs.txt`_  file for your project. Enter the location in the RTD settings to ensure the correct versions of your project tools are used for the RTD build.
    - To set what versions are active, and what the 'latest' branch points to, go to the :menuselection:`Admin --> Advanced Settings` area of the RTD project dashboard.
