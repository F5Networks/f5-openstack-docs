Style and Voice
```````````````

F5's open source documentation follows the F5 'Modern Voice' strategy developed by the Technical Communications team. The core principles of modern voice are:

    - Focus on the customer question.
    - Give a concise answer.
    - Make it easy to scan.
    - Use normal, relaxed words.
    - Empathize.

In other words, don't go off on tangents; don't use 10 words when two will do; pictures, lists, and tables are your friends; use the same words you'd use with a professional colleague; and don't talk down to people.

**Which of those last two paragraphs did you actually read?**

Were your eyes drawn to the list? Did they glaze over when you saw a block of text?

Keep these things in mind when writing your documentation. *It's supposed to help people figure out what they need quickly, so they can get on with their lives*.

.. sidebar:: Style Quick Ref:

    - Use a single space after a period.
    - Use `Oxford commas <https://www.grammarly.com/blog/what-is-the-oxford-comma-and-why-do-people-care-so-much-about-it/>`_.
    - Spell out numbers below 10 ("one", "two", "four", etc.).
    - Use figures for numbers 10 and above.

**F5 Modern Voice Guidelines** [#]_

    **The Cardinal Rule of Global English:** *“Don’t make any change that will sound unnatural to native speakers of English.”*

    **Corollary:** *“There is almost always a natural-sounding alternative if you are creative enough to find it.”*

    Modern Voice is based on industry standards such as Minimalism, Simplified Technical English, Topic-Based Authoring, and Global English. It’s also based on analysis of customer research and trends. As always, customer satisfaction trumps everything, so there certainly are exceptions to these.

    **General guidelines**:

    - Restrict the length of noun clusters to no more than 3 words.
    - Restrict sentence length to no more than 20 words (task-oriented sentences) or 25 words (conceptual sentences).
    - Restrict paragraphs to no more than 6 sentences (in descriptive text).
    - Avoid slang and jargon, while allowing for specific terminology.
    - Make instructions as specific as possible.
    - Use articles such as "a/an" and "the" wherever possible.
    - Use simple verb tenses (past, present, and future).
    - Use active voice. Limit passive voice.
    - Do not use `present participles <http://www.ef.com/english-resources/english-grammar/present-participle/>`_ or `gerunds <http://www.ef.com/english-resources/english-grammar/gerund/>`_ unless they're part of a Technical Name.
    - Do not use gerunds in titles. Make titles active and direct.
    - Do not use metaphors or allusions that people in other cultures might not understand.
    - Use "‘s" to show possession with nouns that denote inanimate objects. **Example**: “…the field’s data area…”

    **Modern Voice 'Forbidden' Words**:

    These words aren’t actually forbidden, per se; but since **nobody talks like this**, we don't write like this either.
