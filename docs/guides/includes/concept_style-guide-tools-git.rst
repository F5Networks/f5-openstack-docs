Git / GitHub
````````````

`Git <https://git-scm.com/>`_ is an open source version control system. `GitHub <https://github.com>`_ is a Git code-hosting platform used for collaboration.

Using Git/ GitHub isn't a requirement per se, but we'd argue that using *some* kind of version control is. Consider the following:

- Due to the collaborative nature of open source projects, which extends to documentation, it's imperative that you have a way of ensuring that contributions from different people are 'safe', resolvable, and traceable.
- Our publication platform, :ref:`Read the Docs` (RTD), requires that content be sourced from Git, `Subversion <http://subversion.tigris.org/>`_, `Bazaar <http://bazaar.canonical.com/>`_,  or `Mercurial <https://www.mercurial-scm.org//>`_ repositories.
- Read the Docs has many built-in features that support GitHub: linking to the docs' source repository; doc versions that correspond to branches and release tags in the source repository; webhooks that build documentation automatically when changes are made to the source repository, etc.
