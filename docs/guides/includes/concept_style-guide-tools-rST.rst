ReStructured Text (rST)
```````````````````````

Plaintext markup languages like `ReStructured Text <http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html>`_ (rST) and `Markdown <https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/>`_ are considered the standard for documenting open source projects. Both are simple and easy to learn. We opted for rST because of its more robust :ref:`Sphinx` functionality and de facto use in `Python project documentation <https://docs.python.org/devguide/documenting.html>`_.

    - `A ReStructuredText Primer <http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/user/rst/quickstart.html>`_
    - `ReStructuredText Directives <http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/ref/rst/directives.html>`_
    - `rST Cheat Sheet <https://github.com/ralsina/rst-cheatsheet/blob/master/rst-cheatsheet.rst>`_

You will need to use a text editor that supports rST. Out of the many options to choose from, we recommend `PyCharm <https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/>`_ (which works beautifully with version control) and `Sublime Text <https://www.sublimetext.com/>`_.
