Sphinx
``````

`Sphinx <http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/index.html>`_ is a Python documentation generator. It's an open source tool that was initially developed for the `Python documentation <https://docs.python.org/>`_ and is the most commonly-used tool for generating documentation of Python projects.

.. note:: Sphinx is awesome.

While you can use Sphinx without knowing Python, a familiarity with Python can be beneficial. It allows you to move past the basic configurations and customize your documentation to meet your project's specific needs.
