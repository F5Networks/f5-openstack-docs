The Topic-Based Approach

    Write once; [reuse] anywhere.

    -- Sun Microsystems

The original slogan for Java -- "write once, run anywhere" -- is a great way to describe the philosophy underlying content reuse in documentation. [#]_ Content reuse helps the doc writer avoid duplication, ensuring consistency and accuracy across the documentation set. It cuts down on the amount of time required to manage updates, since you don't have to find and update the same information in many different places. Additionally, it contributes to greater efficiency on a technical writing (or development) team, since individual writers don't each have to write the same information for their respective deliverables.

It's not all sunshine and rainbows, though. In order for a team to effectively reuse content, everyone has to follow the same approach to writing, structuring, and organizing their content. Enter topic based authoring.

The "topic based authoring" (TBA) approach to content creation and management revolves around the idea of standalone topics which can be used in many different contexts. In conjunction with its sister concept, `"minimalism" <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimalism_(technical_communication)>`_, TBA is the core of F5's Technical Communications strategy.

The traditional TBA approach dictates that a topic can be one of three types: task, concept, or reference. We've bastardized -- or simplified, take your pick -- this somewhat, choosing instead to think of them as three distinct types of content "chunks": topics, concepts, and references.

Topics, Concepts, and References
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For the purposes of this guide, content "chunks" - any content which will be used as part of a larger document - are classified as topics, concepts, or references.

- A :dfn:`topic` is a content unit focused on one subject. [#]_
  A topic should conceivably be able to stand on its own, even if it's unlikely that it actually will. If you're describing a feature and providing instructions for its various configuration options, you're writing a topic.

- A :dfn:`concept` is like an overview: it presents key and/or background information about a topic.
  If you're explaining background or high-level information that's relevant to the feature you're about to describe, you're writing a concept.

- A :dfn:`reference` presents data or raw information that supplement or support the other content types.
  If you're organizing information into a table, you're writing a reference. References should not contained detailed background information (that's a concept) or instructions for how to do something (that's a topic).
