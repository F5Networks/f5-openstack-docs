.. _os_ve_creating_vlans:

VLANs represent a logical collection of hosts that can share network resources. At minimum, you'll need to create three VLANs for use by your BIG-IP: one for the external network, one for the internal network, and one for the management interface. If you're using  :ref:`Device Service Clustering <ve_clusters>`, you'll need to create additional VLANs.
