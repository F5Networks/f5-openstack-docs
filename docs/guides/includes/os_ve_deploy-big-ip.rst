.. _ve_deploy_big-ip:

We recommend using the F5 Openstack Heat templates (`F5Networks/f5-openstack-heat <https://github.com/F5Networks/f5-openstack-heat>`_) to deploy and configure your BIG-IP®. The heat template documentation is on Read The Docs at `f5-openstack-heat.rtfd.org <http://f5-openstack-heat.readthedocs.org/en/>`_.

You can also use the instructions provided in :ref:`Import a VE Image <import-ve-image>` and :ref:`Launch the BIG-IP® <launch_big-ip_instance>` to import an image and launch an instance manually.
