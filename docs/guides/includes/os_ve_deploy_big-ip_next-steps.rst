    You can access the BIG-IP® from the Horizon dashboard via :menuselection:`System --> Instances --> Console`.

    On first launch, the console will display something similar to the following:

        .. code-block:: text

            BIG-IP 11.6.0 Build 0.0.401
            Kernel 2.6.23-358.23.2.e16.f5.x86_64 on an x86_64
                r: ZBYLYQIGZJ   a: MKYBLGHLTB
            localhost login:

    The ``r:`` and ``a:`` strings displayed are randomly-generated passwords for the root and admin accounts, respectively. **Make note of them when they're shown, because they will not be shown again**.

Now that your BIG-IP® VE is running, you will need to configure it. See :ref:`Further Reading <further_reading>` for more information.
