Source Admin Credentials
````````````````````````

.. important::

    You need to source a credentials file with admin permissions (e.g., ``source keystonerc_admin``) to use the ``openstack``, ``nova``, and ``neutron`` commands.

    You can also make configurations via the OpenStack dashboard. See the `OpenStack dashboard user guide <http://docs.openstack.org/user-guide/dashboard.html>`_ for more information.
