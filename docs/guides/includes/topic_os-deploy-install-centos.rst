Install CentOS
``````````````

First, you need to install an operating system on your hardware. We installed `CentOS 7 <http://isoredirect.centos.org/centos/7/isos/x86_64/CentOS-7-x86_64-Everything-1511.iso>`_ on one machine which will serve as the controller, compute, and network nodes (referred to in this document as an 'all-in-one' configuration).

.. note::

    Our lab uses DHCP, which means our machine acquired an IP address automatically. You may need to manually assign a static IP address, which can be easily done as part of the CentOS installation.
