Next Steps
----------

See the :ref:`F5Â® OpenStack configuration guide <os-config-guide>` for instructions on the following basic OpenStack configurations:

    * Neutron Network Configuration
    * Adding projects and users
    * Deploying resources

.. note::

    You can either use the command line or the OpenStack dashboard (the GUI) to configure OpenStack. The dashboard is accessible at the URL provided in the 'successful installation' message; the username and password are found in the file :file:`keystonerc_admin` (created as part of the Packstack deployment).

    If you change your password in the dashboard, be sure to update it in :file:`keystonerc_admin` as well.
