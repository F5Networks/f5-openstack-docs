.. note::

    When installing CentOS, create a root user and a user with administrative privileges. Our root user has the password 'default'; our admin user is 'manager', with the password 'manager'.

    In all command blocks shown in this guide, the assumed user is represented by the command prompt symbol:

    .. code-block:: text

        # = root
        $ = admin
