BIG-IP® Device Service Clustering (DSC) provides synchronization and failover of configuration data across multiple BIG-IP® devices on a network.

BIG-IP® high availability (HA) features, such as connection mirroring, configuration synchronization, and network failover, allow core system services to remain available in the event that a BIG-IP® becomes unavailable.
