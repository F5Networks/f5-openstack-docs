This documentation set provides users of F5速 technologies with an interest in OpenStack a jumping-off point for getting started with F5 in OpenStack. We have guides for simple OpenStack :ref:`deployment <os-deploy-guide>` and :ref:`configuration <os-config-guide>` and for :ref:`deploying BIG-IP速 VE <deploy_big-ip_openstack>` from within an OpenStack cloud.

If you would like to request a new user guide or notify us of an issue with an existing one, please file an `issue <https://github.com/F5Networks/f5-openstack-docs/issues>`_ in GitHub.

***************

F5 currently has a presence in the `OpenStack projects <http://www.openstack.org/software/project-navigator>`_ listed below. Please see our :ref:`Project index` for more information.


Neutron LBaaS
-------------

`Neutron <http://www.openstack.org/software/releases/kilo/components/neutron>`_ is the OpenStack Networking component. The Load-Balancer-as-a-Service (LBaaS) plugin adds load balancing functionality to Neutron. There are two versions -- LBaaSv1 and LBaaSv2 -- for both of which F5 provides tools that enable users to provision BIG-IP速 services in OpenStack.

v1
~~~~

Neutron LBaaSv1 is compatible with OpenStack Juno - Liberty; it was deprecated with the Liberty release.

v2
~~~~

Neutron LBaaSv2 replaced LBaaSv1 in the Liberty release; it is compatible with Liberty and later releases. For LBaaSv2, F5 split its solution into two separate projects: :ref:`f5-openstack-agent <agent:home>` and :ref:`f5-openstack-lbaasv2-driver <lbaasv2:home>`.
