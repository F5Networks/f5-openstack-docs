Multi-tenancy
=============

In a multi-tenant architecture, one BIG-IP can provide services for multiple tenants (interchangeably referred to as 'projects' in OpenStack lingo). Tenant users can be given varying levels of control over their environments, while the administrative user can control all aspects of all projects. See F5's `Network Virtualization: Instances versus Tenants <https://devcentral.f5.com/articles/network-virtualization-instances-versus-tenants>`_ for a more detailed explanation.
