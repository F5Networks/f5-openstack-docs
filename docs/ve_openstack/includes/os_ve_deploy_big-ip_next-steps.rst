Next Steps
==========

Now that you have a BIG-IP installed, youâ€™ll need to configure it.

**IMPORTANT** You can access the BIG-IP through Horizon via :menuselection:`System --> Instances --> Console`. The console will display something similar to the following on first launch:

    .. code-block:: text

        BIG-IP 11.6.0 Build 0.0.401
        Kernel 2.6.23-358.23.2.e16.f5.x86_64 on an x86_64
            r: ZBYLYQIGZJ   a: MKYBLGHLTB
        localhost login:

The 'r:' and 'a:' strings displayed are randomly-generated passwords for the root and admin accounts, respectively. **Make note of them when
they're shown, because they will not be shown again**.
