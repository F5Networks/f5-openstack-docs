<p>#Introduction {#intro}</p>

<p><strong>This document is intended for internal use by F5 employees only.</strong></p>

<p>F5 Networks provides a plug-in for OpenStack that implements the Load Balancing as a Service v1.0 specification. This document provides an overview of the solution’s basic value proposition and describes the major design points defining how the solution works.</p>

<p>This guide describes F5’s OpenStack BIG-IP solution from a high level<br />
functional point of view. It describes the value proposition, the major<br />
components, and the major variations for deploying the solution. The<br />
goal of the document is to help customers choose the appropriate<br />
deployment variation that fits their requirements best.</p>

<p>##Key Terms {#key-terms}</p>

<p><strong>Load Balancing as a Service (LBaaS)</strong>: pronounced <em>el-bass</em>; the provision of load balancing tools as a standalone product.</p>

<p><strong>OpenStack</strong>: an open-source cloud computing platform <a href="http://www.openstack.org">openstack.org</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Neutron</strong>: OpenStack’s networking service. <a href="https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Neutron">openstack.org/wiki/Neutron</a></p>

<hr />

<p>#OpenStack Overview {#openstack-overview}</p>

<p>OpenStack provides infrastructure as a service (IaaS) to institutions and service providers who want to use their existing physical hardware to create large-scale cloud deployments (source: <a href="http://www.openstack.org/projects/openstack-faq/">OpenStack.org</a>).</p>

<p>To find out more about OpenStack, please see <a href="http://www.openstack.org/software/">About OpenStack</a> or the <a href="http://docs.openstack.org">OpenStack documentation</a>.</p>

<p>##OpenStack LBaaS v1.0 {#lbaasintro}</p>

<p>LBaaS is one of many services available for deployment in OpenStack. Typically, an open source plug-in is provided out-of-the box for each service in an OpenStack deployment; you are free to replace the stock plug-in or to add plug-ins as needed.</p>

<p>LBaaS v1.0 has somewhat limited functionality in comparison with that of BIG-IP. A tenant using LBaaS 1.0 can create a pool; add pool members; configure a monitor; set a persistence method; and add a virtual server. Additional features are planned for future releases of OpenStack. Any advanced F5 services a customer wishes to deploy need to be configured via the BIG-IQ or BIG-IP management interface.</p>

<h2 id="interfaces">Service Model and Interfaces</h2>

<p>OpenStack has a standardized GUI, API, and command line interface (CLI). The configuration interfaces are identical regardless of the type of plug-in you use (stock or vendor). The standardization provides an advantage in terms of testing, documenting, training, and operating an OpenStack deployment.</p>

<h3 id="api">API</h3>

<p>The OpenStack API uses <a href="http://docs.openstack.org/developer/keystone/api_curl_examples.html">Keystone</a> tokens for authentication.</p>

<p>The most common way to use the OpenStack API is via a <a href="https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/OpenStackClients">command-line client</a>. These python-based clients are available in the standard operating system package repositories.</p>

<pre><code>**TIP:** For [Neutron](https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Neutron), the download/install commands are `apt-get install python-neutronclient` or `yum install python-neutronclient` for Ubuntu and Centos/Red Hat, respectively. 
</code></pre>

<p>You can also send API requests via cURL, REST clients, or create automated scripts via the <a href="http://docs.openstack.org/user-guide/sdk.html">OpenStack Python SDK</a>.</p>

<p>For more information, see the OpenStack Documentation: <a href="http://developer.openstack.org/api-ref-networking-v2-ext.html#lbaas-v1.0">API for LBaaS v1.0</a></p>

<h3 id="cli">Command Line Interface</h3>

<p>The Neutron CLI is available for download as part of the <a href="https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/OpenStackClients#python-neutronclient">Neutron client package</a>.</p>

<p>The load balancing commands are a subset of the <a href="http://docs.openstack.org/cli-reference/content/neutronclient_commands.html">OpenStack Neutron command set</a>. Each is prefaced with “lb-“.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Commands that start with “lbaas-“ are for LBaaSv2 and are not currently supported.</p>

<h3 id="gui">GUI</h3>

<p>The OpenStack GUI - also called the ‘Dashboard’ - allows users to access and control their OpenStack resources. For more information, see <a href="https://www.openstack.org/software/openstack-dashboard/">OpenStack Dashboard</a>.</p>

<h2 id="openstack-supported-releases">Supported Releases</h2>

<p>The F5 OpenStack LBaaS solution is supported on the OpenStack Icehouse,<br />
Juno, and Kilo releases. Liberty support is planned.</p>

<h2 id="lbaas-version">Versions</h2>

<p>OpenStack LBaaS v1.0 is the only version currently supported. Please see the <a href="http://go/roadmap">roadmap</a> for information regarding support for LBaaS v2.0.</p>

<p>#F5 Solution Overview {#f5-solution-overview}</p>

<h2 id="solution-intro">Introduction</h2>

<p>The F5 OpenStack LBaaS solution will be formally supported as part of the BIG-IQ product in a future, as-yet-undetermined release.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> This solution has a number of major limitations, outlined in this document, which should be carefully examined and considered. and taken seriously. <strong>There is no guarantee that the solution will work should any variation, no matter how seemingly minor, from the test implementation be made.</strong></p>

<h2 id="solution-components">Solution Components</h2>

<p>The F5 LBaaS solution consists of the following components: <br />
 - Driver package: accepts the LBaaS requests from OpenStack;<br />
 - Agent package:  the Driver uses the Agent to fan out request handling to<br />
appropriate BIG-IPs;<br />
 - iApp package: <strong>must be installed on the BIG-IPs to create the necessary BIG-IP configuration objects</strong>;<br />
 - BIG-IQ: manages devices and deployed services.</p>

<p>These packages are contained in a BIG-IQ directory and must be installed on the appropriate OpenStack machines and BIG-IPs to use the F5 LBaaS solution.</p>

<p>Detailed deployment instructions are available in the <a href="">F5 OpenStack Deployment Guide</a>.</p>

<h2 id="f5-platforms">F5 supported platforms</h2>

<p>The solution supports the use of BIG-IP VEs, BIG-IP HW Appliances, or<br />
VCMP instances, including VCMP instances for the Viprion Chassis.</p>

<p>There are <a href="#bigiq-deployment">limitations</a> on which platforms can be used in<br />
combination with BIG-IQ. These limitations are expected to be addressed in future BIG-IQ releases.</p>

<p>LineRate and Service Delivery Controller platforms are not supported.</p>

<h2 id="bigip">BIG-IP</h2>

<p>BIG-IP can be used directly in an OpenStack project, or as a shared cluster. The F5 LBaaS plug-in applies the iApp configurations to any BIG-IP deployed directly within a project. If BIG-IP is not deployed within a project, the plug-in falls back to a multi-tenant, shared BIG-IP cluster.</p>

<h3 id="bigip-deployment">Deployment and Scalability</h3>

<p><strong>The solution does not automatically deploy BIG-IPs</strong>. The tenant must condfigure all BIG-IPs manually. Furthermore, the solution cannot monitor capacity or deploy additional BIG-IPs to handle increased traffic.</p>

<p>However, when the tenant has a number of BIG-IPs configured, the F5 LBaaS driver <em>can</em> scale out deployments across that BIG-IP pool.</p>

<h3 id="bigip-sdn">MultiTenant SDN/Overlay Integration</h3>

<p>The F5 LBaaS solution integrates with the OpenStack networking (SDN) implementation. This allows BIG-IP to communicate with any VM on any network in OpenStack.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> This feature currently only works with the standard Neutron ML2 networking implementation with Open vSwitch.</p>

<h3 id="bigip-versions">BIG-IP Versions</h3>

<p>The F5 LBaaS plug-in can be used with any F5 hardware which supports <strong>version 11.5.0</strong> or higher.</p>

<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Depending on your configuration, an F5 Hot Fix may also be<br />
required.</p>

<h3 id="bigip-sriov">SR-IOV Performance</h3>

<p>Single root I/O virtualization (SR-IOV) allows a virtual machine to access a network card directly, allowing for higher performance. The standard OpenStack networking environment is complex and involves multiple layers, which reduces latency and throughput. With SR-IOV, the packets bypass all of these layers and go directly to the virtual machine.</p>

<p>SR-IOV is available starting in the Juno release of OpenStack and F5<br />
recommends using SR-IOV in combination with the F5 BIG-IP Virtual<br />
Edition in order to achieve the highest performance. The F5 TMOS<br />
OpenStack deployment guide provides details on how to use SR-IOV.</p>

<h2 id="bigiq">BIG-IQ</h2>

<p>The F5 OpenStack LBaaS solution is oriented around the F5 BIG-IQ<br />
management product. This document describes the solution that will be<br />
available in a future release of BIG-IQ. Unfortunately, a projected<br />
release date is not available at this time.</p>

<p>BIG-IQ can be used to discover a BIG-IP in a tenant’s OpenStack project<br />
and to deploy LBaaS iApp services to that BIG-IP when the tenant<br />
configures LBaaS via OpenStack.</p>

<p>Note that it is possible to configure the solution in such a way that<br />
the OpenStack plug-in configures BIG-IPs directly. In this scenario,<br />
deploying BIG-IQ is technically not necessary for the solution to work.<br />
However, we recommend using BIG-IQ for its device management (including<br />
device licensing), rich monitoring features, and other features which<br />
will provide for a better overall LBaaS solution. Our roadmap is heavily<br />
oriented towards BIG-IQ and the solution design may evolve to the point<br />
where we require the using BIG-IQ for the solution to work. For example,<br />
the automated deployment of additional BIG-IPs for additional capacity<br />
is expected to be available in the future only through use of the BIG-IQ<br />
product. Therefore, even if you do not plan to use BIG-IQ initially, we<br />
recommend planning for that in the future and for the reasons stated,<br />
this solution is only supported by purchasing a BIG-IQ support contract.</p>

<h3 id="bigiq-deployment">Deployment</h3>

<p><strong>When BIG-IQ is used as part of the OpenStack LBaaS solution, the<br />
BIG-IQ can only deploy an iApp to a standalone BIG-IP Virtual Edition<br />
dedicated to a single tenant.</strong> That does not mean you cannot use<br />
hardware or use BIG-IP in an HA or shared configuration. It just means<br />
that if you choose those kinds of deployments, the BIG-IQ will not be<br />
involved in deploying the service to the BIG-IP(s). The OpenStack<br />
plug-in itself will need to configure the BIG-IPs when BIG-IQ is unable<br />
to.</p>

<p>Keep in mind however that our best-practice, recommended solution going<br />
forward is to use BIG-IQ for deploying all OpenStack LBaaS services. We<br />
are focused on addressing the limitations of BIG-IQ in the near future.</p>

<p>It should be noted that tenant-dedicated BIG-IPs can only use pool members that are on networks that are pre-connected directly to the BIG-IP VE (in the same tenant project) or that can be reach via routing. In other words, the BIG-IP will not be able to utilize VLAN tags or tunnel interfaces to reach the<br />
private networks of other tenants.</p>

<h3 id="versions-bigiq-versions">Versions {bigiq-versions}</h3>

<p>This solution requires a future version of BIG-IQ (TBD).</p>

<h2 id="requirements_limitations">System Requirements and Limitations</h2>

<h3 id="opsys">Operating Systems</h3>

<p>Testing is limited to Ubuntu 12.04 and 14.04, CentOS / RedHat 6.5 and 7.0.</p>

<p>Mirantis OpenStack is a short term goal. HP Helion is a goal.</p>

<h3 id="multitenancy-nonNeutron">Multi-Tenancy and Alternative (non-ML2) Neutron Plug-ins</h3>

<p>If you intend to use a multi-tenant configuration model for your BIG-IPs,<br />
then be aware that that solution only works with certain OpenStack<br />
networking configurations. If you use tunneling (e.g. VXLAN or GRE),<br />
BIG-IP needs to participate in the control plane for the tunneling<br />
implementation in order to learn where the other tunnel endpoints are.</p>

<p><strong>This integration has only been done with the standard Neutron ML2<br />
plug-in that ships by default with OpenStack.</strong></p>

<p>If the OpenStack deployment is using an alternative implementation, such<br />
as NSX, Nuage, Contrail, PlumGrid, OpenDaylight, MidoKura, etc, then<br />
multi-tenancy is not available at this time. F5 has integrations in<br />
development for some of these alternatives. Please see the roadmap.</p>

<h3 id="documentation">Documentation</h3>

<p><em>F5 OpenStack LBaaS Solution Overview (This document)</em></p>

<p><em>F5 OpenStack ADC Integration Guide</em></p>

<p>This guide dives deep into the networking issues surrounding the<br />
integration of BIG-IPs with OpenStack. The intent of the document is to<br />
help the customer understand the technical requirements that flow from<br />
the preliminary deployment choices the customer has made (for example,<br />
whether to use multitenant BIG-IPs, or whether to use VLANs or GRE<br />
tunnels) after reading the Solution Overview document. After making<br />
preliminary choices, the customer should take a look at the detailed<br />
technical issues regarding those choices to ensure they understand the<br />
pros and cons of their choice.</p>

<p><em>F5 OpenStack LBaaS Deployment Guide</em></p>

<p>This guide covers the specific steps for setting up and configuring F5’s<br />
OpenStack solution. It covers how to deploy the overall solution,<br />
including BIG-IQ, BIG-IP(s), and the F5 LBaaS Plug-in for OpenStack. It<br />
also covers operating and troubleshooting the OpenStack solution. It<br />
presumes the OpenStack Solution Overview and the ADC Integration Guide<br />
have been read and the appropriate deployment decisions have been made.</p>

<p><em>F5 OpenStack LBaaS Plug-in Design Guide</em></p>

<p>This guide describes the design and operation of the F5 LBaaS plug-in.<br />

<h3 id="section">\</h3>
<p>Support Policy and Early Access</p>

<p>Support for this solution requires a valid BIG-IQ support contract.</p>

<p>If the customer intends to use multitenant BIG-IPs, that aspect of the<br />
solution will be considered Early Access until BIG-IQ supports this<br />
scenario directly. Our supported, best-practice, recommended solution<br />
going forward is to use BIG-IQ for deploying all OpenStack LBaaS<br />
services. However, we realize that BIG-IQ currently has certain<br />
limitations that could prevent BIG-IQ from deploying iApps in a<br />
multitenant, HA scenario (such as setting the proper partition,<br />
traffic-group, and route domain). While we are focused on addressing<br />
those limitations in the near future, we realize that customers strongly<br />
desire a solution they work with as soon as possible.</p>

<p>So, in lieu of the fully enabled BIG-IQ solution, we are implementing<br />
the above mentioned scenarios by having the OpenStack plug-in directly<br />
deploy iApps to BIG-IP using the REST interface. In that scenario,<br />
BIG-IQ will not be involved in deploying the iApp. However, in parallel,<br />
we are designing and implementing the BIG-IQ functionality that will<br />
allow BIG-IQ to deploy those iApps in a multi-tenant, HA fashion. As we<br />
work through this design, we are anticipating that we may evolve the<br />
configuration scheme (such as naming conventions) as we go. Therefore,<br />
the configurations deployed without using BIG-IQ should be considered<br />
subject to change. There may be updates to the Early Access code and<br />
configurations already deployed without using BIG-IQ may not migrate<br />
forward. Migration tools may be provided at F5’s discretion, but<br />
customers should not rely on tools being provided and they should<br />
seriously consider this issue when planning their dev, test, and<br />
production roll-outs.</p>

<p>F5 will provide updates as time goes by as to the state of the solution<br />
and when the Early Access status will be lifted.</p>

<p>To address an urgent customer demand, there may be code available prior<br />
to release, for example during Beta testing, but that will mainly depend<br />
on the size of the customer opportunity and what resources are available<br />
to support the customer. With sufficient money on the table, we could<br />
probably provide a preliminary form of the solution or perhaps a demo,<br />
in the near term. Short of that, the BIG-IQ release timeline is the one<br />
to track for this feature.</p>

<p>To be clear, the Early Access status for the multitenant use case will<br />
likely apply to the BIG-IQ release, not just preliminary software that<br />
may have been provided prior to the release.</p>

<p>\<br />
F5 BIG-IQ OpenStack Roadmap<br />
—————————</p>

<p>These requirements are on the BIG-IQ roadmap. Generally, specific<br />
release dates are not available for these features.</p>

<h3 id="big-iq-and-f5-hardware">BIG-IQ and F5 Hardware</h3>

<p>For the current OpenStack solution, BIG-IQ can only discovers a BIG-IP<br />
running as a VM in the OpenStack tenant’s project. We intend to support<br />
using any kind of BIG-IP platform to support the LBaaS service.</p>

<h3 id="big-iq-and-multitenant-big-ips">BIG-IQ and MultiTenant BIG-IPS</h3>

<p>For the current OpenStack solution, BIG-IQ each tenant must have a<br />
dedicated BIG-IP. We intend to support multi-tenant configurations using<br />
BIG-IP Partitions and Route Domains to isolate the configuration and<br />
network traffic, respectively.</p>

<h3 id="big-iq-and-high-availability">BIG-IQ and High Availability</h3>

<p>We intend to support having BIG-IQ deploy an iApp to BIG-IPs configured<br />
for high availability, not just standalone devices.</p>

<h3 id="lbaas-v1-for-openstack-kilo">LBaaS v1 for OpenStack Kilo</h3>

<p>We intend to get the current LBaaS v1 plug-in working with the Kilo<br />
OpenStack release. Note that Kilo is still under development. Our Kilo<br />
support may not be available at the time Kilo is release - no specific<br />
time frame has been committed.</p>

<h3 id="lbaas-v2-for-openstack-kilo">LBaaS v2 for OpenStack Kilo</h3>

<p>We intend to support the LBaaS v2.0 specification. Note that full LBaaS<br />
v2.0 support is part of the Kilo release which has not been released<br />
yet.</p>

<h3 id="alternative-sdn-controllers">Alternative SDN Controllers</h3>

<p>As explained previously in this document, the multitenant features<br />
require integration with the control plane of the SDN implementation and<br />
this integration has only been done with the standard Neutron ML2<br />
networking implementation with Open vSwitch.</p>

<p>F5 intends to have integrations with various other SDN Controllers. NSX,<br />
Nuage, Contrail, and OpenDaylight are on this list. No specific date has<br />
been committed for these integrations to be completed. Additional<br />
controllers may be added to this list in the future.</p>

<p>It should be restated that using a BIG-IP in a multi-tenant fashion<br />
requires SDN integration. Therefore, if you intend to use an SDN<br />
controller other than the stock Neutron ML2, you are limited to a model<br />
where a separate BIG-IP Virtual Edition is necessary for each tenant.</p>
