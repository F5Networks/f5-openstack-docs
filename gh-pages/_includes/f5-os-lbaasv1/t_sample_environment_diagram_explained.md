The diagram below shows a sample configured LBaaS OpenStack environment using the F5 OpenStack LBaaSv1 Plugin. The Plugin Agent communicates with a BIG-IP platform or Virtual Edition via iApps. The load balancing service request is handled by the BIG-IP according to its configurations; it can then connect, discover, and/or deploy to the cloud-based apps or vms in the OpenStack project network.
